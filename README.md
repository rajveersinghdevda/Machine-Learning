# Machine-Learning
1.	From the attached data set, visualise the data set and find the correlation between the features.
2.	Apply the multiple linear regression and generate the regression model. find out its parameter and check whether the estimate estimated parameters are correct or not.
3.	For the attached data set, check whether multi collinearity exists in your data set or not.
4.	For the attached data set, check whether non-normality exists in your data set or not
5.  Apply LDA on the attached data set and find out the first appropriate direction or the first axis.
6.	Quantize the dependent variable of the data set and make them discrete. Apply LDA over the dataset and build the classifier.
7.	Apply the principal component model on the attached and find out the appropriate number of dimensions.
8.	Apply factor model on the same data set.
9.	Using the same data set apply k means clustering. Remember you must reject the dependent variable.
